        <h2>The Moon</h2>
        <p>
          The Moon is a top-down adventure game, which depicts an ordinary day
          in a life of a busy girl as a student.
        </p>
        <p>
          An unexpected day comes when she gets teleported to another dimension,
          where she meets the love of her life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The style, gameplay and feel was motivated by Undertale, since it is
          one of my favorite games.
        </p>
        <p>Code, art, sounds and everything was done by my from ground up.</p>
        <p>
          I had to learn the GameMaker script, how the engine worked and other
          things to construct this on the GMS2 engine.
        </p>
        <p>It is yet to be finished, since January, I have created:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic movement and interaction</li>
          <li>Dialogue system</li>
          <li>Cutscene-like sequences</li>
          <li>Art and Sounds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The art and setting that I envisioned is quite extensive, as the story
          will take a turn
        </p>
        <p>
          and transport you to a different dimension. After I create the art,
          I'd like finalize it.
        </p>
        <p>Here is a small demo video of current build.</p>

        <h2>CHIP-8 Emulator</h2>
        <p>Since I love gaming and hardware, I thought, why not give myself a challenge to make something that does both?</p>
        <p>I thought that an emulator would be a good start, since it is a low-level project and it would be a good learning experience.</p>
        <p>I implemented CPU, Memory, Display, and sound generation by code!</p>
        <p>You can find the source code and a release <a href="https://github.com/memory-hunter/cH80s">here</a></p>

        <h2>EosEngine</h2>
        <img src="res/eosengine.png" alt="EosEngine" />
        <p>EosEngine is a game engine that was created by a team of 4 people at my university, including me.</p>
        <p>It was done using LWJGL library on Java. I mostly was on the graphical side of things.</p>
        <p>I was responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Implementing the whole rendering pipeline</li>
          <li>Object loading</li>
          <li>Texturing</li>
          <li>Lighting</li>
          <li>Random-height terrain generation</li>
          <li>General improvements/optimizations in the engine core</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/KIU-GEDGADA/EosEngine">here</a></p>
        <p>Here is a small demo video of the current state of the engine.</p>

        <h2>Galaxies, please!</h2>
        <p>Galaxies, please! is a "Papers, please!"-esque game, in which you are tasked to identify galaxies correctly, given an image taken by the JWST.</p>
        <p>This was created on a NASA Space Apps Hackathon 2022 alongside 3 other people. I used PyGame library to program the game.</p>
        <p>I was responsible for programming the whole gameplay and game loop.</p>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr>
        <img src="res/portrait.jpg" alt="me, hehe">
        <p>Greetings, fellow traveller!</p>
        <p>I'm Davit Petriashvili, a software engineer based in Georgia.</p>
        <p>
          I invite you my to my portfolio page with open hands, baring all I
          love and have created.
        </p>
        <p>My air, water and food is video games.</p>
        <p>
          My level of admiration towards games, their creators and hardware that
          runs them is inexplicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love them so much that I decided I would dedicate my life to
          creating them and preserving them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also passionate about creating optimized software, toolkits and
          love the low-level playground.
        </p>
        <p>
          Combining hardware with software/games has always been one of my
          delights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a look at my projects and shenanigans. Contact me if you like
          them!
